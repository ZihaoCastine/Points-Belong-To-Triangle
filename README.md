You have to complete the given function pointsBelongToTriangle that takes integers x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, p1, q1, p2 and q2 as its arguments and returns one integer from {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.
(x1, y1) is the coordinate of point A. (x2, y2) is the coordinate of point B. (x3, y3) is the coordinate of point C. (p1, q1) is the coordinate of point P. (p2, q2) is the coordinate of point Q.
The return value is:
0: If points A, B and C don't form a triangle.
1: If point P "belongs to the triangle" ABC but point Q doesn't.
2: If point Q belongs to the triangle ABC but point
P doesn't.
3: If both points P and Q belong to the triangle ABC. 4 : If neither point P nor point Q belong to the triangle.
Note
A point "belongs to a triangle" if it lies on or inside the triangle.
